# Audacia.Typescript

### Write typescript and generating typescript modules from C# assemblies.

This solution consists of two main projects:

- [Audacia.Typescript](https://github.com/audaciaconsulting/Audacia.Typescript/tree/master/Audacia.Typescript)
- [Audacia.Typescript.Transpiler](https://github.com/audaciaconsulting/Audacia.Typescript/tree/master/Audacia.Typescript.Transpiler)

The base project contains classes for generating typescript programatically in C#, in a consistent and clean way.
The transpiler project contains classes and tooling for reflecting C# assemblies at build time and generating typescript modules based on them.
Please follow their respective links above for more information on each.

_Please note: this project is still in its early stages._
